# Indie Game Developer
![Magenta Crystal](/assets/default/images/items/magentaCrystal_lite.svg)

I began my journey of self-learning in game development and programming around 2002, when I was in junior high school.

Like most teenagers, I found PC games to be magical and captivating. However, the idea of creating my own game seemed even more incredible to me.

I was eager to create my own game at that time. I had countless ideas and all I needed was a way to bring them to life. So, I decided to start learning how to make `Flash games`.

## Disclaimer
As we all know, `Flash` is a technology that is now considered obsolete, and it's nearly impossible to find any games made with Flash on the internet today. Despite the technology being outdated, the programming style, design patterns, system architectures, and all the skills I acquired for game development are still with me. These skills have proven to be very useful and can be applied to other projects in different languages and frameworks that I am working on.

That's why I believe it's worth mentioning my previous [Flash game projects](#flash-game-projects). I hold the view that a general understanding of programming and design ability is more important than the specific language or framework used.

I'll begin this chapter by sharing a bit of my story. Feel free to skip this part and proceed directly to my [Flash game projects](#flash-game-projects) if you're not interested in this section.

## The Beginning of My Programming Journey
`Macromedia Flash MX` and `Action Script 2.0` were the first tools and language I used on my programming journey.

During my high school days, I dedicated most of my free time to making games. Sometimes, I would become so hyperfocused on my game projects that I would forget to eat or even have difficulty falling asleep.

Unlike other teenagers, I didn't spend my free time playing games. Instead, I found making games to be much more enjoyable. I believe that the time I've spent making games and coding exceeds the time I've spent playing games in my entire life.

During this period, I undertook numerous projects, conducted extensive research, and performed various experiments to compensate for my initial lack of skills and knowledge. It was a time of struggle and exploration as I strived to create my ideal game.

Eventually, the effort I invested enabled me to implement most of the ideas and features that came to mind.

## First Encounter with OOP
After using `Action Script 2.0` for a couple of years, I decided it was time to transition to the new `Action Script 3.0` language, a strongly-typed OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) language. This was my first introduction to the concept of OOP.

I quickly fell in love with OOP as it seemed to be the perfect solution I had been searching for. Maintaining a codebase that had grown beyond a certain level was a significant challenge before I discovered OOP.

At that time, I had already reached the maximum scale that a game could be implemented without OOP. I was struggling to find a solution that would allow me to expand the codebase while keeping it maintainable and preventing it from turning into a pile of spaghetti code.

Eventually, OOP became my preferred approach, and I have been coding in the OOP style ever since.

## Flash Game Projects
By the time I entered college, I had already acquired a significant level of skills, enabling me to create almost any type of Flash game I wanted to build, given enough time.

That's when I started making games for friends and offering them for free play.

Here are the most notable ones that I'd like to share with you:

- [ÊãØÊïëÂ©öÁ¶ÆÂ§ß‰ΩúÊà∞ (The Wedding Protector)](#-the-wedding-protector)
    - I created this game as a gift for my friend to celebrate her wedding. In the game, you play as the protector, tasked with preventing the bride or groom from being kidnapped by evil aliens.

## ÊãØÊïëÂ©öÁ¶ÆÂ§ß‰ΩúÊà∞ (The Wedding Protector)

![The Wedding Protector Cover Image](/images/game_wedding_m_23.png)

This is a game that I made as a gift for my friend to celebrate her wedding.

### Story
Your friend is getting married. Unknown to her and her future husband, they have been targeted by curious aliens. These aliens are intrigued by the concept of love and marriage and have decided to kidnap the couple to study them further. The aliens plan to kidnap the bride and groom on their way to the wedding ceremony.

Fortunately, you and your friends have discovered the aliens' plan in advance. You decide to act as protectors, with a mission to ensure the bride and groom reach their wedding ceremony safely and on time.

### Characters
![Characters Image 1](/images/game_wedding_m_01.png)

In the game, there are two protectors: the shooter and the martial artist. The shooter is armed with a crossbow that shoots paper balls, which are surprisingly effective against aliensüòÜ. The martial artist excels at jumping and can punch and kick the aliens with bare hands.

![Characters Image 2](/images/game_wedding_m_02.png)

You have the option to play as either the shooter or the martial artist, with the computer controlling the other character.

You can also choose to protect either the bride or the groom. The bride runs faster than the groom, but the groom, being heavier, is harder for the UFO to abduct.

### How to Play
![Gameplay Image 17](/images/game_wedding_m_17.png)

If you choose to protect the bride, the groom will wait for her at the wedding ceremony. The bride will attempt to reach the ceremony by running from the left side of the screen to the right side.

Aliens will appear along the way, trying to abduct the bride. Your task is to protect her by shooting the aliens with the crossbow or by punching and kicking them.

The same applies if you choose to protect the groom.

![Gameplay Image 19](/images/game_wedding_m_19.png)

üëÜ Don't let your guard down even when the bride is finally reaching the wedding ceremony. The aliens will attempt to abduct her at the last moment.

![Gameplay Image 22](/images/game_wedding_m_22.png)

üëÜ Mission Accomplished! You only win when the bride reaches the groom at the end of the stage.

### Special Features

**Buildings**

![Gameplay Buildings Image](/images/game_wedding_27.png)

- Buildings are scattered throughout the game. Protectors can climb these structures to gain a height advantage, making it easier to shoot or punch the UFOs.

**The Bunker**

![The Bunker Image](/images/game_wedding_26.png)

- The bunker is a special structure you can find along the way. It offers a safe place for the bride to hide from the aliens.
- The drawback of using the bunker is that the bride cannot move while she is inside. If the bride stays in the bunker for too long, she may miss the wedding ceremony, resulting in a game loss.

**T4 Support**

![Gameplay Image 15](/images/game_wedding_m_15.png)

- The Volkswagen T4 camper van is a unique vehicle that can be called upon for assistance. 
- The van begins at the start of the stage and moves from left to right. It picks up the bride (or groom) along the way, providing a quicker and safer path to the wedding ceremony.
- The T4 can protect the bride from being abducted by the UFO. However, you still need to protect the T4 from the aliens, as it will stop moving temporarily if it gets hit by the UFO's beam.
- You can only use this feature after you have destroyed a specific number of UFOs and aliens.
- Press SHIFT to call the T4 for support.

## Ë≠¶Âå™ËøΩÈÄê (Car Chasing)
![Car Chasing Cover Image](/images/game_car_m_06.png)

There was a movie called `Taxi` (1998) that I watched when I was a kid. The movie was about a taxi driver who was also a skilled driver. The chase scenes in the movie were so exciting that I was inspired to create a car chase game.

Well, what can be more exciting than challanging your driving skills by driving a car at high speed, performing drifts, and trying to escape from the police?

### Story
![First stage screenshot](/images/game_car_02.png)

Let me summarize the game's story here for your reference, as the narrative in the game is written in Chinese:

You're a novice racer who has just purchased a new sports car. You've recently met your coach at his club and have begun your first training session.

Your coach is a generous individual who is eager to share all his knowledge about racing. Under his guidance, your driving skills are quickly improving, and he soon becomes your closest friend.

As your trust in your coach grows, an unexpected event takes place.

One day, you walk into the club to find it empty. Your coach and all the staff are nowhere to be found. You're left feeling confused and worried.

Eventually, you find a staff member hiding in the club. He tells you that the club has been raided by the police for no apparent reason. The staff member also reveals that your coach has been taken away by the police.

As the game progresses, you uncover hints that reveal your coach is one of the leaders of a rebel group fighting against a corrupt government. The club is actually a secret base for this group.

Upon realizing the truth about your country, you decide to join the rebels. Using the exceptional driving skills you've learned from your coach, you begin your fight against the corrupt government. This marks the start of an endless series of car chases.

### How to Play
![Chase scene screenshot](/images/game_car_03.png)

The victory conditions vary for each stage. In most stages, you must pass through a series of checkpoints to complete the stage. However, some stages require you to destroy a specific number of police cars to finish the stage.

![Gameplay Image 12](/images/game_car_m_12.png)

Additionally, some stages have a time limit. You'll see a red bar at the top of the screen that decreases as time passes. You must complete the stage before this bar runs out.

![Gameplay Image 16](/images/game_car_m_13.png)

And of course, you must avoid having your car destroyed by the police. The green bar at the bottom of the screen represents your car's health. If your car is destroyed, you lose the game. Therefore, remember to repair your car at the repair shop when it sustains damage.

![Gameplay Image 14](/images/game_car_m_14.png)

Your score for each stage is determined by how quickly you complete it. The faster you finish the stage, the higher your score will be.

![Gameplay Image 15](/images/game_car_m_15.png)

You need to accumulate a certain score to unlock the next stage. This means you may need to replay the stage multiple times to accumulate enough points if your score is not high enough.

## Weapons
![Weapons image](/images/game_car_20.png)

There are three types of weapons you can use in the game:

**Lubricant oil**

![Lubricant oil image](/images/game_car_22.png)

- Lubricant oil is the main weapon you can use against police cars. It's a non-lethal tool that makes police cars lose control, helping you evade them.
- Use this when you're encircled by police cars and need to escape.

**Smoke Flare**

![Smoke flare image](/images/game_car_21.png)

- The smoke flare is another tool you can use to hinder police cars. It temporarily blocks their vision, slowing them down.
- Deploy this when you're being chased by police cars and need to create some distance between you and them.

**Petrol Bomb**

![Petrol bomb image](/images/game_car_19.png)
- The petrol bomb is the only lethal weapon you can use to destroy police cars. It's a powerful weapon that can damage multiple targets within its blast radius.
- To cause the most damage, keep the target at the center of the blast radius when throwing the petrol bomb.
- Caution: Avoid throwing the petrol bomb while driving backward, as this can cause damage to your own vehicle.
- Throwing the petrol bomb while freezing the target with smoke flare is a good strategy.

### Special Features

**Drift**

![Drift scene](/images/game_car_16.png)

- Drifting is a special technique that allows you to make sharp turns at high speed. It's a useful skill for evading the police and avoiding obstacles.
- To perform a drift, press the Down Arrow key while turning left or right at high speed.

**Repair Shop**

![Repair shop](/images/game_car_17.png)

- The repair shop is a unique structure that you can find in some stages. It allows you to repair your car.
- A red light on top of the repair shop will glow when it's available for use. Once the repair is complete, the light will turn off, indicating that the shop needs to cool down before it can be used again.
- Keep in mind that all vehicles, including police cars, can use the repair shop.

**Police Station**

![Police station](/images/game_car_18.png)

- The police station is a unique structure found in some stages. It serves as the dispatch center for police cars and also repairs them.
- Similar to the repair shop, the police station has a red light on top that illuminates when it's available for repairing police cars.
- Damaged police cars will return to the station for repairs and rejoin the stage once they're fixed.
- A white light on top of the police station indicates readiness to dispatch a new police car.
- If the number of police cars on the stage is less than the maximum, the station will dispatch additional cars.
- The police station will not repair your car. Driving your car into the station will have no effect.

**Map Editor**

![Map editor](/images/game_car_m_23.png)

- The game comes with a map editor that allows you to create your own stages. You can design the map, place buildings, and set the victory conditions for your custom stages.
- You can also copy the map data (a string of characters) and share it with your friends. They can then paste the data into the game to play your custom stages.

### Controls
- Press the SPACE key to start the stage.
- Use the Up Arrow key to accelerate.
- Use the Down Arrow key to brake or reverse.
- Use the Left and Right Arrow keys to steer left and right.
- Press the SHIFT key to use the primary weapon (lubricant oil).
- Press the Z key to use the secondary weapon (smoke flare).
- Press the X key to use the special weapon (petrol bomb).

### Download and Play
Please feel free to [download Car Chasing](/files/CarChasing.7z) and give it a try. I hope you enjoy it! üòä

The game is a Windows executable file. After unzipping the file, you can start the game by clicking on the .exe file.

Please note: This game does not include any sound effects.

There is an older version (V1) of the game included in the download, which serves to demonstrate the game's development process. This version was a prototype I created to test the game's core mechanics.

The latest version (V2) is a complete rebuild from scratch, featuring many more features and improvements.
