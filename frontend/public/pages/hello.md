Welcome to **Playground by Andrash**!

I'm Andrash, the creator of this space. This is where I share my creations with the world. I hope you enjoy your time here.

Here are some handy tips to get you started.

## Tips

- ### Go Fullscreen

  This playground is best experienced in fullscreen mode. You can toggle fullscreen mode by pressing `F11` on your keyboard or by clicking the fullscreen button `🖥️` on the top left corner of the navigation bar.

- ### Just Tap

  Swiping or other touch gestures won't work here. You can only interact by tapping or clicking.

- ### Best on Chrome or Edge

  This playground is optimized for `Google Chrome` and `Microsoft Edge` on desktop. `Google Chrome` on mobile is also recommended. You might experience some lag on other browsers.

- ### Explore Like You're in a Museum

  Think of this playground as a fun experiment to make website navigation feel more like a game. It's not quite a game yet, more like an online museum where you can explore and interact with exhibits alongside other visitors.

- ### Interact With Crystals
  To learn more about this playground and its creator, interact with more crystals and items around the playground.

## Don't Miss These Features

- ### Real-time Multiplayer

  Bring your friends along for the ride! Switch to `Online Mode` in the mode menu `🏝️` from the navigation bar first. Then, share the link in the address bar with your friends. They can join you by clicking the link. Alternatively, you can invite your friends by sharing the link from the `Players` menu `👥` in the navigation bar.

- ### Map Editor
  Unleash your creativity with the map editor. Create your own playground and walk around in it with your character. However, sharing or inviting others to your own playground isn't supported yet. To use this feature, switch to `Editor Mode` in the mode menu `🏝️` from the navigation bar.

## That's All For Now 😊

Go ahead and explore the playground. Have fun!
