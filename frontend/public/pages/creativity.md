# Creativity

![Ferris Wheel Icon](/assets/default/images/items/ferrisWheel.svg)

I am Andrash, the creator of this site.

I consider myself a creative person who is constantly challenging myself with new things.

I'm not afraid of learning new skills or facing unknown challenges. Because this is what I have been doing all my life. I learn new things because I enjoy it. I learn new things so that I can acquire the necessary skills to create something that I have always wanted to build.

The only thing I fear is repetition and boredom. Some people would like every day of their life to be the same. They want their job to be predictable, with no surprises or unknown challenges. I am certainly not one of them.
 
 I need new challenges to keep me alive, a space full of unknowns where I can use my creativity.
 
 Simply put, I'm too creative to do a boring job. If you need someone to do something you already know how to do, and you want me to do it exactly the way you do it, month after month, year after year, I beg you not to hire me. I'm not the right person for you.
 
However, if you are a creator yourself, or someone who values creativity and understands the importance of providing the space for a creation to be born, we might work well together.
