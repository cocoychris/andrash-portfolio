# Creativity

![Ferris Wheel Icon](/assets/default/images/items/ferrisWheel.svg)

I am Andrash, the creator of this site.

I consider myself a creative person who is constantly challenging myself with new things.

I'm not afraid of learning new skills or facing unknown challenges. Because this is what I have been doing all my life. I learn new things because I enjoy it. I learn new things so that I can acquire the necessary skills to create something that I have always wanted to build.

The only thing I fear is repetition and boredom. Some people would like every day of their life to be the same. They want their job to be predictable, without unknown challenges. I am certainly not one of them.
 
I need new challenges to keep me alive and a space where I can use my creativity.
 
if you are a creator yourself, or someone who values creativity and understands the importance of providing the space for a creation to be born, we might work well together.
