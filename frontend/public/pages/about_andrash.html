    <h2>Full-stack Projects</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Playground by Andrash</strong>: This website is built on top
          of a self-developed <code>Multiplayer Online Game Engine</code> to
          provide an unconventional game-like web browsing experience to
          visitors.
        </p>
        <p>
          It also includes a <code>Map Editor</code>, a tool that I designed to
          help create the playgrounds for this website. I decided to make it
          public so that others can also use it to create their own playgrounds.
        </p>
        <p>

          <a href="/page/md/about_this_place">About This Place</a> page.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Automated Robot Platform (ARP) System</strong>: A web-based
          RPA (Robotic Process Automation) system that allows users to manage
          and execute automated tasks from a web browser on a dedicated server.
        </p>
        <p>
          The system can run multiple tasks simultaneously and supports a wide
          range of tasks including web scraping, file processing, database
          operations, mouse and keyboard operations, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was an internal project for a company I worked for. I proposed
          the idea, designed the system, and implemented the entire project from
          scratch.
        </p>
        <p>
          The project was a great success and has been used by the company for
          more than 2 years. It has become an essential tool for automating
          repetitive tasks across multiple departments.
        </p>
        <p>
          Technologies used in the project: <code>Node.js</code>,
          <code>Express.js</code>, <code>EJS</code>, <code>jQuery</code>,
          <code>Puppeteer</code>, <code>Nut.js</code>, <code>PostgreSQL</code>,
          <code>MSSQL</code>.

      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Strengths</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Highly self-sufficient and self-motivated. Capable of designing and
        implementing a project from scratch and learning whatever is needed to
        get the job done.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Expected Working Environment</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        100% remote work. No need to relocate. Or at least 95% remote work if
        the company is located in Taiwan.
      </li>
      <li>
        A team where the members truly believe that the product they are
        building on is cool, not just a job to make a living.
      </li>
      <li>
        A team with a flat hierarchy and a high degree of autonomy, where
        everyone is treated equally and has the freedom to make decisions and
        take actions within their own scope of work.
      </li>
      <li>
        A team that values the quality of the product and user satisfaction more
        than the quantity of work done.
      </li>
      <li>
        A team that values the ability to learn and adapt more than experience
        in a specific technology.
      </li>
      <li>
        A team that welcomes new ideas, values creativity, and is willing to
        optimize the workflow to reduce unnecessary work.
      </li>
      <li>
        No extra reporting or documentation work just for assessment and
        performance evaluation. Everyone should be able to focus on their work
        and let their work speak for itself, rather than spending time on
        proving themselves.
