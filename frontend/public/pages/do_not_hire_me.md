# Do Not Hire Me

![Magenta Crystal](/assets/default/images/items/magentaCrystal_lite.svg)

Although I am looking for a suitable position where I can utilize my skills and creativity to build cool products, I am also aware that my unique personality may not fit into every work environment.

Instead of immediately considering hiring me, I suggest that you start by considering reasons not to hire me.

Especially if the following circumstances apply to you:
1. If you perceive this as a joke or find such unconventional expressions offensive, please disregard this and refrain from hiring me.
2. If you are looking for an employee who can strictly follow orders, even if your demand contradicts the profession of the position, I am not the one for you.
3. If you are not looking for someone who is creative and has the ability to adapt and learn new skills to solve a problem or create a brand new product never seen before, I am not the person for you.
4. If you are building the product just to make a living, not because it is the coolest thing you have ever thought of and you are itching to get it out into the world with your whole life, then I am definitely not the person for you.
5. If you are the kind of person who tends to judge a book by its cover and not even bother to read a single page of it. Like judging a person by their previous title, position, and degree, and not even bothering to check out their portfolio and code on GitHub, then you're not the person I want to work with.
6. Are you happy? If you rarely think about this question, or if you think it is an irrelevant question. I'm not going to risk my life working with/for an unhappy person or someone who doesn't even care.

Thank you for reading and taking your valuable time to consider not hiring me. You can stop reading now and move on to something more important. Much appreciated.

In a very rare case, if you still think I might be the right person for your team, please feel free to contact me:
